- ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¦Š Hiya, I'm Brady! I'm a digital artist, animator, and character designer exploring programming and gamedevelopment!

- I'm workin' on learning GD Script as well as HTML and CSS! I also want to make some non-gamedev related programming projects!
- I'm also a huge nerd for vintage Macs and other Apple devices as well as Unix and Linux!

- Please check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bradyfoxartist/) and [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bradyfoxart.bsky.social) for the latest of what I'm working on! As well as my [carrd](https://bradyfoxart.carrd.co/#) for my other socials and stuff about me!
- I'm also working on a personal [nekoweb](https://bradyfoxart.nekoweb.org) site for blog related stuff and as an art and project gallery! ðŸ‘€
